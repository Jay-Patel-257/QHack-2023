# Ground State Energy of BeH2 at different bond length using VQE

### About Project:
This project is aimed at finding the ground state energy of Beryllium Hydride ($BeH_2$) at differennt bond length between Berillium($Be$) and Hydrogen($H$) atoms. To do so we use Hybrid Quantum Classical algorithm called Variational Quantum Eigensolver or VQE.
